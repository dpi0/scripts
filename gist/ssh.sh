AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Defines the SFTP subsystem used when a client requests an SFTP session. Using

# improving security and removing dependence on an external binary.
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

# Forces the use of SSH protocol version 2, which provides better security than
# the now-deprecated protocol version 1.
Protocol 2

# Sets the TCP port on which the SSH daemon listens. Replacing the default port 22
# with a variable ($SSH_PORT) allows running SSH on a non-standard port to reduce
# the visibility to automated scans.
Port $SSH_PORT

# Increases the verbosity of SSH server logs. Useful for debugging authentication issues
# or auditing access, as it logs detailed information about connections and actions.
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Restricts SSH login access to a specific user (defined by $SSH_USER). This prevents
# other system users from attempting to authenticate via SSH, reducing attack surface.
# AllowUsers $SSH_USER

# Enables integration with the system‚Äôs Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), which
# handle things like login restrictions, session limits, or 2FA, depending on the PAM setup.
UsePAM yes

# Restricts SSH login access to users who are members of the specified group(s).
# In this case, only users who are part of the "sshusers" group are permitted to log in via SSH.
# If a user is not in this group, even if they have valid credentials and keys, access is denied.

PasswordAuthentication no

PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Begins a conditional block that applies only to the user specified by $SSH_USER.
# All nested directives under this block override global settings when this user connects.
# Match user $SSH_USER

    # Enables authentication using public keys. This allows the user to log in using
    # an SSH key pair rather than a password, which is generally more secure.
    # PubkeyAuthentication yes

    # Disables password authentication entirely for this user, ensuring that only
    # public key authentication is allowed. Helps prevent brute-force password attacks.
    # PasswordAuthentication no

# Prevents the root user from logging in over SSH. This is a best practice to minimize
# risk, as root login provides full system control and is often targeted in attacks.
PermitRootLogin no

# Disallows login attempts with empty passwords. Ensures that no account without
# a proper password (or key) can log in, even if the system user exists.
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Disables challenge-response authentication mechanisms, such as keyboard-interactive
# logins, unless implemented via PAM. This further enforces key-only authentication.
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Disables X11 forwarding over SSH, which prevents GUI applications from being
# displayed remotely. This improves security by reducing attack vectors.
X11Forwarding no

# Disables port forwarding, preventing the user from establishing network tunnels
# (e.g., forwarding local ports to remote services), which could be abused to bypass firewalls.
AllowTcpForwarding no

# Disables SSH agent forwarding, preventing the remote system from accessing
# the client's SSH agent and potentially misusing stored private keys.
AllowAgentForwarding no

# Defines the interval (in seconds) between keepalive messages sent by the server
# to the client. Helps detect broken or idle connections.
ClientAliveInterval $ALIVE_INTERVAL_SEC

# Specifies how many consecutive keepalive messages can be missed before the server
# disconnects the client. Together with ClientAliveInterval, this acts as an idle timeout mechanism.
ClientAliveCountMax $ALIVE_COUNT_MAX


# Limits the number of authentication attempts per connection to 2.
# After two failed attempts (e.g., wrong password or key), the connection is closed.
# This helps mitigate brute-force attacks by reducing the time window for guessing credentials.
MaxAuthTries 2

# Limits the number of multiplexed SSH sessions (e.g., via $(ControlMaster))
# per network connection to 2. This restricts how many concurrent channels
# (like shell, exec, or port forwarding) a user can open at once.
MaxSessions 2

# Sets the limit on concurrent unauthenticated connections. In this case:
# - The server allows 2 simultaneous unauthenticated connections.
# - Additional connection attempts are randomly dropped to prevent DoS attacks.
# Syntax: MaxStartups [start]:[rate]:[full]
# Setting it to a single number ("2") is shorthand for allowing only 2 unauthenticated connections before dropping others.
MaxStartups 2

# Disables Unix domain socket forwarding (e.g., for services like Docker or gpg-agent).
# Prevents clients from creating local socket tunnels to the server, improving isolation.
AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# Disallows remote clients from binding forwarded ports to external interfaces (0.0.0.0).
# With this set to "no", SSH port forwarding can only bind to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1),
# preventing users from exposing internal services externally via GatewayPorts.
GatewayPorts no

# Prevents users from creating IP-level tunnels (e.g., with $(ssh -w) for tun/tap devices).
# Disabling this hardens the server against abuse of VPN-like features via SSH.
PermitTunnel no

# Disables TCP keepalive messages at the TCP protocol layer.
# When set to "no", the SSH server relies solely on SSH-level keepalives (e.g., ClientAliveInterval)
# to detect dead or idle connections.
# This reduces false disconnects caused by temporary network issues,
# but makes detection of stale sessions dependent on SSH keepalive settings.
